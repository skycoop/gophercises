These are my solutions for Jon Calhoun's [gophercises](https://gophercises.com/)

## Exercise 1: [Quiz](https://github.com/gophercises/quiz) ([solution](quiz/main.go))
Completed parts 1 and 2, as well as both bonus tasks. I was already sold on Go's concurrency abstraction but writing 
this drove home how powerful it could be. I'm very pleased with the simplicity, although the stupid issue with the 
random seed is driving me crazy. For some reason I keep getting the same value out of `time.Now()` on my Windows 
10 system. I'm still a little unsure on how best to handle command line flags. The `flags` module is great for handling 
the parsing, but I feel like I'm using it slightly wrong...

## Exercise 2: [URL Shortener](https://github.com/gophercises/urlshort) ([solution](urlshort))
Solution pending :stuck_out_tongue:. I'm went off-script for this one, mostly because there's a cool project here that I
wanted to try and build out fully.
